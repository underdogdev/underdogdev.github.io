Here is the little story about how and why I put this site on Jekyll and have it hosted on Github for free. 

I wanted to have a blog for some time and with my past experiences with wordpress or other content management systems, I didn't really know where to start. It's not that I don't know how they work, I just could never like wordpress. A lot of procrastination and months later I discovered Jekyll. Jekyll is "a simple, blog aware, static site generator". So what does it mean? It means that you can host your blog on github pages, for free and with your domain name of choice (if you want it anyway). It's pretty easy to use. God knows I had much more fun learning the console commands and version control than trying to learn how wordpress works. 

Ok let's get to the facts I like about jekyll;
  
  - No database, no CMS means that you write your content in Markdown and Jekyll generates your static website through templates.
  
  - It's really fast because it's without database you just serve static pages
  
  - It doesn't have the vulnerabilities Wordpress has so no security updates whatsoever.
  
  - Hosting is free. As soon as I read it was free so, no strings attached, I immediately gave it a try and boy I'm loving it.
  
I should say there is a disadvantage especially for non-developers, you need to have ruby installed on your computer. But since you are a dev reading this page it shouldn't be a problem for you. Setting up everything takes some time. Especially if you are a first time Git user like me. But afterwards uploading a post takes literally seconds. I am writing this blog post on my own laptop and Brackets which is my favourite editor at the moment. And if you want to export your content from Wordpress to Jekyll there is a plugin called [Wordpress to Jekyll Importer][wordpress-jekyll].

I suggest everybody to take a look at what [Jekyll][jekyll] has to offer. I like it and there is no going back to Wordpress.
